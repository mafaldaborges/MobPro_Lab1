#Lab 1: Restaurant App

###Celina Bekins, Mafalda Borges, Mary Keenan

**Additional Feature**: Customize ingredients for Customers & Feedback for Orders

**Repo**: [songbird175/MobPro_Lab1](https://github.com/songbird175/MobPro_Lab1)

**Divide Up Work**:

Mary: Create Feedback function (customer clicks button, goes to new fragment, does cool stuff, can be seen in Chef mode and maybe the Chef reports them on FB and sends them hate mail idk weâ€™ll see)

Celina: Create and store the menu as a list which customers can open and chefs can edit

Mafalda: Edit/save/delete individual items within a list that comprises the order


**In a week**: A basic functional version of the app (MVP)
